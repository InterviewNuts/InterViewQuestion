Q1. Minimum Number of Platforms
You have been given two arrays, 'AT' and 'DT', representing the arrival and departure times 
of all trains that reach a railway station.
Your task is to find the minimum number of platforms required for the railway station 
so that no train needs to wait.

Q2.

You are given a string ‘str’ of ‘N’ lowercase alphabets. Your task is to check whether it is possible 
to split the given string into three non-empty substrings such that one of them is a 
substring of another two.
For example:
‘str’ = 'abcabab', we can split this string into 3 string a, b, c as a = 'abc', b = 'ab', c = 'abc', 
we can clearly see that b is a substring of both a and c.

Q3) Reverse Edges
You are given a directed graph of ‘N’ nodes and ‘M’ edges. Also, you have two nodes ‘A’ and ‘B’. 
Your task is to make at least one valid path from ‘A’ to ‘B’ by doing the below operations a 
minimum number of times.
Choose two nodes ‘X’ and ‘Y’, such that there exists an edge from ‘X’ to ‘Y’. 
Delete edge ‘X’ to ‘Y’. Add edge ‘Y’ to ‘X’.
You need to print the minimum operations that you have done.

Input Format
The first line of input contains an integer 'T' representing the number of test cases. 
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers ‘N’ and ‘M’ where ‘N’ 
denotes the total number of nodes and ‘M’ denotes the total number of edges in the graph. 
The second line of each test case contains two space-separated integers ‘X’ and ‘Y’ where ‘X’ 
denotes the starting node of the path and ‘Y’ denotes the ending node of the path. The next ‘M’ 
lines contain two space-separated integers ‘U’ and ‘V’ where ‘U’ and ‘V’ represent the nodes that 
share an edge from ‘U’ to ‘V’.

Q4. Lexicographic Permutation Rank
Ninja got holiday homework from his English teacher. His teacher gave him a string and told him to 
find the rank of the string if the string is sorted in lexicographical order.
Ninja is very new into programming, he didn’t know how to solve this question but he has to solve 
this question as this question has a very heavy weightage among all the questions given in holiday 

homework.
Ninja knows that you are a very good programmer who has practiced a lot of questions. Help Ninja!.

Q5. Ninja And Stack Of Boxes
Ninja has been given ‘N’ rectangular 3-D ‘BOXES’. Each box has dimensions Length ‘L’, Breadth ‘B’ and 
Height ‘H’. Ninja has to create a stack of boxes as tall as possible. But there is a condition to do so.
You can only place a box on top of another box only if the dimensions of the 2-D base of the lower 
box are each strictly larger than those of the 2-D base of the higher box. You can rotate any box 
so that any side of the box is used as a base. You can take multiple instances of any box.
Can you help the Ninja to create a stack of boxes as tall as possible?.
