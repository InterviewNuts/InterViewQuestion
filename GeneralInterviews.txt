1)
Given a binary tree and a number X, find all the nodes at a distance X from root and 
all the nodes at a distance X from leaf nodes.

2)
Given an array of integers and an integer X. Find all subsets of the array whose sum of elements 
is equal to the integer X.

3)You have two integer arrays – WELL and DISC. Each integer of WELL represents the maximum width 
of a disc that can pass through it in left to right direction. Given a series of discs of 
varying width, find out how many discs can be fit in the WELL until the WELL gets full.

4)
You have an array of numbers. You have to give the range in which each number is the maximum element. 
For example, if the array is 1, 5, 4, 3, 6. The output would be:
1 [1, 1]
5 [1, 4]
4 [3, 4]
3 [4, 4]
